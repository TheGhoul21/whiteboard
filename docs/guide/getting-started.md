Whiteboard is designed to be intuitive. You can start in your browser or install the desktop app for a more professional setup.

## 1. Choose Your Version

| Web Version | Desktop App (Recommended) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Zero Install.** Works in any modern browser. | **Dual-Window Mode.** Perfect for recording. |
| No OBS window capture optimization. | Optimized for OBS (Frameless window). |

## 2. The Golden Rules of Whiteboard

To get the most out of Whiteboard, remember these three interactions:

### 🖋️ Drawing is the Core
Press **P** for the Pen or **S** for the Smooth Pen. Everything you draw is vector-based, so it stays crisp at any zoom level.

### 📋 Paste is Magic
Don't look for "Insert" buttons. Just **Cmd+V** (or Ctrl+V) anything:
- **Text:** Becomes a text object.
- **Code:** Paste code blocks (e.g., ` ```python ... ``` `) for syntax highlighting.
- **Math:** Paste LaTeX (e.g., `$$ E=mc^2 $$`) for beautiful formulas.
- **Images:** Pastes directly onto the canvas.

### 🎥 Control vs. Presentation
If you're using the Desktop App, click the **Open Presentation** button in the bottom right.
- **Control Window:** Where you have the toolbar, frames, and settings.
- **Presentation Window:** A clean view showing *only* the canvas. This is what you record in OBS.

## 3. Essential Shortcuts

Master these to draw while you talk without looking for buttons:

| Shortcut | Action |
| :--- | :--- |
| **H** | Hand Tool (Pan the canvas) |
| **P** | Pen Tool |
| **S** | Smooth Pen (Fountain pen style) |
| **E** | Eraser |
| **Cmd + Z** | Undo (Essential for perfection!) |
| **Space (Hold)** | Quick Pan |
| **Scroll / Pinch** | Zoom in/out |
